# FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form

More information about project requirements:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form

The project assignment is designed to assess knowledge of `<form>` elements and to create a basic survey form with minimal functionality. Requirements included using multiple types of `<input>` elements, form validation checks on specific elements, and proper grouping of elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes. 

Form submission functionality was not a requirement so the survey does not send any form data anywhere.
